## SDN Simulation ##
**pysim** is an example of SDN for PN7xxx.

### Observer Pattern ###
**pysim** implements Observer Pattern for nodes, ports, fibs and scripts.

### predefined topo statics ###
use a dictionary to store all about user's network, and can be modified and get reloaded later.

### auto-routing ###
Find the shortest path with Dijkstra's algorithm

 - no limit on number of nodes
 - can reload topo

### auto-scripting ###
- CCC, port AC only yet
- should manually clear room for configurations
- can auto delete scripts generated by itself after route changed

### auto-distributing ###

- telnet
- occupy CFG#
- about 10 lines per second

### auto-checking ###
- telnet
- one by one

### modules ###
- topo : elements of a networks(topo, node, port and fib)
- conn : telnet implement
- pub  : parent class
- route: paths, include route searching
- action: scripts acts
- cfg/test: a test case

### how to use ###

 1. write cfg.py
 2. load
 3. check
 3. pathfind
 4. distributing
 5. loop of check-find-distribut
